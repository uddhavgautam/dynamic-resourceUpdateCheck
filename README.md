# dynamic-resourceUpdateCheck
No PUSH server, you can find an alternative solution like this. If you want to know what is the least time (best -case scenario) to keep sending Http if-modified-since request to know about dynamic resource update frequency, you can use this tool. You can start from any number of samples between 1 to 99. The initial time-interval that that the thread -- the thread used to send http if-modified-since-- is 9 seconds, which you can't change. But whatever you get the result after the processing from this app, the least time-interval is the what you want to use in your any other project.
